# Observer-Pattern
This is one of the most common Design Patterns in Java.

I've implemented a simple example in Java-Swing. 

I basically have a unique JFrame which is the Subject with JButtons inside and as many as Observer JFrames I want, identical to the Subject JFrame. 

The main scope here is that when I click a button only from the Subject JFrame, the same button it seems to be clicked at the Observer JFrames.

**1. Choose how many observers you want.**
